# Real-Time Availability/Calendar System - Troubleshooting Report

## System Overview
The Real-Time Availability/Calendar System has been systematically analyzed and several issues have been identified and fixed. The system includes:

- **Database Schema**: TalentAvailability model with AvailabilityStatus enum
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/talent/availability` and `/api/availability/check`
- **UI Components**: TalentCalendar, AvailabilityChecker, AvailabilityLegend
- **Integration**: Booking system availability checking
- **Dashboard**: Talent availability management page

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Issue**: `react-big-calendar` was missing from package.json
**Fix**: Added `"react-big-calendar": "^1.8.2"` to dependencies
**Impact**: Calendar component would fail to render without this dependency

### 2. API Endpoint Access Control
**Issue**: AvailabilityDisplay component couldn't fetch availability for specific talents
**Fix**: Modified `/api/talent/availability` GET endpoint to support:
- Talents fetching their own availability (no talentId parameter)
- Organizers fetching specific talent availability (with talentId parameter)
**Impact**: Organizers can now view talent availability before booking

### 3. Booking Conflict Detection
**Issue**: Availability checking didn't properly handle event end times
**Fix**: Enhanced booking conflict detection in `checkTalentAvailability()` to:
- Check both proposed and accepted dates
- Consider event end times when available
- Handle cases where eventEndDateTime is null
**Impact**: More accurate conflict detection prevents double bookings

### 4. Recurring Availability Generation
**Issue**: Date iteration could create incorrect time calculations
**Fix**: Improved `generateRecurringAvailability()` function to:
- Properly handle time zones and date calculations
- Add safety limits to prevent infinite loops
- Correctly handle overnight events
**Impact**: Recurring availability entries are generated accurately

### 5. Form Validation
**Issue**: Calendar form lacked proper validation
**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation for:
- Start/end date validation
- Recurring availability settings validation
- Proper error handling with loading state management
**Impact**: Better user experience with clear error messages

### 6. Database Schema Validation
**Status**: ✅ Verified - Schema is properly defined
- TalentAvailability model with correct fields
- AvailabilityStatus enum with AVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE, BUSY
- Proper indexes and foreign key relationships
- Migration files are correctly structured

### 7. API Endpoints Functionality
**Status**: ✅ Verified and Enhanced
- GET `/api/talent/availability` - Enhanced to support organizer access
- POST `/api/talent/availability` - Proper validation and authorization
- DELETE `/api/talent/availability/[id]` - Secure deletion with ownership verification
- POST `/api/availability/check` - Comprehensive availability checking

### 8. UI Components Integration
**Status**: ✅ Verified
- All required UI components exist (card, button, badge, dialog, etc.)
- TalentCalendar component properly imports react-big-calendar
- AvailabilityChecker provides real-time availability feedback
- AvailabilityLegend shows clear status indicators

## System Architecture

### Database Layer
```
TalentAvailability {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  talentId: String (Foreign Key to User)
  startDate: DateTime
  endDate: DateTime
  status: AvailabilityStatus
  isRecurring: Boolean
  recurringPattern: String?
  recurringDays: Int[]
  notes: String?
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### API Layer
- **Authentication**: Session-based with role checking
- **Authorization**: Talents manage own availability, Organizers can view
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **Integration**: Seamless booking system integration

### UI Layer
- **Calendar View**: Interactive calendar with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Form Management**: Comprehensive form with validation
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after changes
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## Integration Points

### Booking System Integration
- Availability checking before booking creation
- Conflict detection and prevention
- Real-time availability status updates

### User Dashboard Integration
- Talent availability management page
- Organizer booking flow integration
- Admin oversight capabilities

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Test availability checking logic
- Test recurring availability generation
- Test form validation functions

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with different user roles
- Test booking creation with availability checking
- Test calendar component interactions

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete availability management workflow
- Test booking flow with availability checking
- Test recurring availability creation and display

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on talentId, startDate, endDate, and status
- Efficient query patterns for availability checking
- Bulk operations for recurring availability

### API Optimization
- Proper pagination for large date ranges
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

### UI Optimization
- Lazy loading for calendar components
- Debounced form validation
- Optimistic UI updates

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Ownership verification for modifications

### Data Validation
- Server-side input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### API Security
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Deployment Checklist

### Dependencies
- [ ] Install react-big-calendar: `npm install react-big-calendar@^1.8.2`
- [ ] Verify all UI components are available
- [ ] Check date-fns compatibility
