## ❌ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. SSE Real-Time Connection ❌
- **Status:** AUTHENTICATION ISSUE (Enhancement Feature)
- **Problem:** SSE endpoint redirecting to authentication page
- **Root Cause:** Session cookies not properly passed to SSE connection
- **Impact:** Non-critical - Core messaging works without real-time updates
- **Technical Details:**
  ```
  Request: GET /api/websocket
  Response: 307 Redirect to /api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fapi%2Fwebsocket
  ```

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Email Verification Issue

- **Solution:** Updated seed script to set `emailVerified: new Date()` and `isEmailVerified: true`
- **Files Modified:** `/scripts/seed.ts`
- **Result:** ✅ Authentication now working for all test users

### 2. EventSource Constructor Issue  
- **Problem:** `EventSource is not a constructor` error in Node.js tests
- **Solution:** Fixed import pattern: `const { EventSource } = require('eventsource')`
- **Files Modified:** Test scripts
- **Result:** ✅ SSE constructor issue resolved
