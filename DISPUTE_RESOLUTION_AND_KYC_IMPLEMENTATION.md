# Dispute Resolution & KYC Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of two critical features for the Gig-Secure platform:

1. **Complete Dispute Resolution Flow** - Enhanced financial transaction logic with comprehensive refund and payout handling
2. **Secure KYC File Uploads** - Enhanced file upload system with advanced security validations

## 1. Complete Dispute Resolution Flow

### Features Implemented

#### Core Service (`lib/services/disputeService.ts`)
- **Comprehensive Financial Logic**: Handles all dispute resolution scenarios with proper transaction tracking
- **Paystack Integration**: Automated refund processing through Paystack API
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all dispute resolution actions
- **Multi-scenario Support**: Organizer favor, talent favor, and partial resolutions

#### Resolution Types

1. **Organizer Favor**
   - Full refund to organizer via Paystack
   - Booking status changed to CANCELLED
   - Transaction records created for audit

2. **Talent Favor**
   - Payout to talent with 5% dispute resolution fee
   - Booking status changed to COMPLETED
   - Payout record created for processing

3. **Partial Resolution**
   - Custom split between refund and payout
   - Dispute resolution fee applied to payout portion
   - Flexible amount allocation

#### Financial Transaction Handling

```typescript
// Example: Organizer Favor Resolution
{
  refundAmount: 1000,      // Full booking amount
  payoutAmount: 0,         // No payout to talent
  paystackRefundId: "ref_123", // Paystack refund reference
  transactionId: "txn_456"     // Database transaction record
}

// Example: Talent Favor Resolution
{
  refundAmount: 0,         // No refund
  payoutAmount: 950,       // 1000 - 5% dispute fee
  payoutTransactionId: "txn_789"
}

// Example: Partial Resolution
{
  refundAmount: 400,       // Partial refund to organizer
  payoutAmount: 570,       // 600 - 5% dispute fee
  paystackRefundId: "ref_123",
  payoutTransactionId: "txn_789"
}
```

export const UPLOAD_CONFIGS = {
  KYC: {
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    allowedMimeTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'],
    allowedExtensions: ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.pdf'],
    minFileSize: 10 * 1024, // 10KB minimum

## 3. Integration & Testing

### Database Integration

Both features integrate seamlessly with existing Prisma schema:
- Dispute resolution uses existing `Dispute`, `Booking`, `Transaction`, `Refund`, and `Payout` models
- KYC system uses existing `KycSubmission` and `KycDocument` models
- Enhanced audit logging through `AdminAuditLog`

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`: File exceeds size limit
- `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`: Unsupported MIME type
- `EXTENSION_MISMATCH`: File extension doesn't match MIME type
- `INVALID_FILE_SIGNATURE`: File content doesn't match declared type
- `DANGEROUS_FILE_TYPE`: Potentially dangerous file extension

### Testing

Comprehensive test suites created:
- `tests/dispute-resolution.test.js`: Dispute resolution service tests
- `tests/kyc-service.test.js`: KYC service functionality tests
- `tests/file-upload.test.js`: File upload security tests

### Performance Considerations

1. **Database Transactions**
   - All critical operations wrapped in database transactions
   - Rollback on failure to maintain data consistency

2. **File Processing**
   - Efficient file validation with early termination
   - Minimal memory usage for large files
   - Asynchronous processing where possible

3. **Notification System**
   - Non-blocking notification sending
   - Graceful degradation if notifications fail
